# Crypto Tracker
A simple excel based application which utilizes macros. A side project made for a friend.

Made to track your cryptocurrency (and 1 friend's): 
* Transactions 
* Latest Prices based on transactions or manually 
* Summary of the amount in each currency 
* Summary of total deposits, holdings, amount sold and profits 

### Installation 
Please ensure your macros are enabled (File -> Options -> Trust Center -> Trust Center Settings  -> Macro Settings)

### Manual 
1. Rename the last 2 sheets with your names to update the summary page with your names
2. Users only have to fill in the first 5 columns under each user and the application will do the rest (Currency, Price, Date, Time, Amount, Units)

* Do note that the currency is case sensitive
